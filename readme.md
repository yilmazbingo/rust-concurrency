Concurrency is programming term. It is about multiple tasks which starts to run and complete in overlapping time periods in No Specific order. concurrency is managed by the os. threads have race conditions problem when multiple threads want to access to the same resource. Also they have deadlocks where they wait for each other, prevents themselves running.
For example, you want to speak while you eat. first you need to swallow the food in your mouth or stop chewing and then you can speak (you are swtiching threads), after speaking you can take another bite.

Parallelism is a hardware termn.It is about multiple tasks or subtasks of the same task that literally run at the same time on a hardware with multiple computing resources like multicore processors. If you could speak while you were chewing food this would be parallelism. An example for parallelism is, a person can sing and dance simultaneously.
